# Job Helmet

_"Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?" - **Charlie Kelly**_

## About

Job Helmet is a job hunting tool that pulls data from popular job sites and compiles them into a single managable list. The project is still in the early stages of development and not yet meant for public use.

## Development

The project is still in the very early stages of development. If you would like to contribute, please read the contributing docs and peek at the blueprint for an idea about where the direction will be headed.

At the moment, I don't anticipate any open contributions but will heavily rework the documents of this project once it's closer to nearing an initial release.
